# Grief Classification for TAPS (Spring 2025)
- Developed and evaluated machine learning classification models (Naïve Bayes) to predict grief stages from survey data, achieving 89% test accuracy and strong F-1 performance.
- Applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis and text preprocessing, to extract meaning from open-ended survey responses and improve model accuracy by 8%.
- Engineered features from 23-question survey responses, integrating textual sentiment outputs with structured variables for model training.
- Conducted model comparison and evaluation, testing multiple algorithms and selecting Naïve Bayes for its reliability and scalability on large, text-heavy datasets.
- Translated analytical outputs into clear, actionable visualizations and business insights, enabling non-technical stakeholders to understand model results and apply them to real-world decision-making.
